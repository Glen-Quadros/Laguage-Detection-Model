# Laguage-Detection-Model

Language detection is the process of automatically identifying the language of a given text or speech. A language detection model is a machine learning algorithm trained to recognize and classify languages based on various features such as vocabulary, grammar, syntax, and character n-grams. These models are trained on large datasets of text in different languages and use statistical and computational techniques to make accurate predictions about the language of a given input. Language detection models have many practical applications, such as in multilingual chatbots, language translation, and content filtering. They are typically evaluated on metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall, and their performance can be further improved through techniques such as ensemble learning and active learning.
